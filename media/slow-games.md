Slow Games are physical video games with a very low frequency of interaction: one move a day.

The games are based on classic video games (Mario, Pong, etc). By reducing the feedback loop to a frequency of a day, the games take a new perspective and the skills required to make progress are radically different. While traditional video games require good hand-eye coordination and concentration, Slow Games challenge our memory, capacity of observation and patience.

Slow Games are ambient video game consoles, meant to blend into the home environment.
