This video consists of a movie of one day in SFPC, and the similar images of every frame suggested by Google's image search algorithm. My question was "How long does Google take to find the identical image for every frame?".

I uploaded all of the images of the original frames and then I ran a script every day from Oct 20 2013 to Nov 19 2013 in order to generate a new video by retrieving images via Google's search algorithm.
The video displayed on the left is composed of the original photos and the video on the right is created from the similar images retrieved via Google's search algorithm.
