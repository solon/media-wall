Azbycx is a Python program that rearranges video samples from a videofile, mixing its frames algorithmically. The program makes automatically a process that would take hundred of hours of manual labour to complete. The result is an avant-garde found footage shortfilm that lets the user watch the beginning and the ending of a story at the same time.
