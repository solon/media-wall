The Manual Reader is a wall display that aims to provide a more conscious way of consuming digital information.

As opposed to most screens where content flows within the viewport, the Manual Reader requires the user to physically move the display to reveal information. The device provides haptic feedback for each pixel move, increasing the perception on the length of the message and the pace at which it is being read.
